# Geometry

The geometry functions generate objects with manipulatable attributes as well as functions for geometry operations.

## Geometries

- Point
- Group
- Polygon
- Path
- Algorithm

Geometries can be of type static, editable or of type computed.
Computed geometries

All geometries have functions such as translate,

## Point
The point geometry is a fundamental object which stands at the source for all the other geometries.
Attributes are:
x
y
z
In mathematical speak you could say that a point is a 3-dimensional vector.
In the making of an algorithm you can add extra attributes to a point, which you might refer back to in later functions.

__Editable points__
Points can have the attribute __editable__ set to true.
This indicates to the interface that  that

## Group
A group is an array of points. Some or all points may be editable.


## Algorithm
A generative algorithm is special a type of higher level geometry.
